This is syntax highlighting for the lucid hardware description language
created by embedded micro. Lucid is a superset of Verilog which is easier
 to use and has extensions for many common operations, such as creating
 flipflops and state machines. Mojo IDE only supports their mojo FPGA board,
 though.

## Features

Basic syntax highlighting

## Roadmap

1. support for all language constructs
2. support for constraints files (ucf), nets
3. invoking mojo with build runner? maybe even ISE?


## Requirements

At this time there are no further requirements.
You ideally want to install Xilinx ISE and Mojo IDE to actually compile the code.
For details see [embedded micro](https://embeddedmicro.com/tutorials/mojo-software-and-updates/installing-ise) instructions.


## Extension Settings

At this time there are no configurable settings

## Releases
